    <h1>Hysterectomy and its Silent Cost</h1>
   <p>Evidence based Information regarding the adverse effects associated with hysterectomy:</p>
   <p>Hysterectomy is a drastic procedure to remove the uterus; it becomes essential in some cases. Recovery after hysterectomy can be prolonged and challenging. 
One of the prevailing professional apprehensions in recent years has been the increase in incidence of many health issues, post hysterectomy, like- 
Heart disease, Dementia, Osteoporosis, Insomnia, Joint pains, Migraine, Mood swings, decline in cognitive function, Urinary incontinence, Weight gain, Increased lipids, Diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease etc. underlining the argument that a medically successful operation does not essentially equate holistic success.
Prevalence: In more economically developed countries, about 40% of women will have hysterectomy by the time they are 60 years old.
Women aged 40–49 years had a high prevalence of hysterectomy (9.3%) in India. That is almost 1 in every 10 women. It is done for other age groups as well but its data is not available at the moment. Seeing the population of India it is a huge number.</p>

<p><b>Facts based on researches:</b></p>
<p>Most hysterectomies are performed in premenopausal adult women to treat benign conditions BESIDES OVARIAN, UTERINE AND CERVICAL CANCERS.</p>
<p>

<div class="facts">
  <div class="facts_c1">

<p>1. *According to a study published in Lancet, fifty-six women who have had hysterectomy done in the previous five years and fifty-six women who had had other operations answered a specially designed questionnaire. The results showed that hysterectomy is more commonly followed by several distressing symptoms than other operations. 
70% of the hysterectomy patients had postoperative depression and an almost equal number had hot flushes and urinary symptoms, and experienced extreme tiredness postoperatively. 
About 50% the hysterectomy patients had headaches, dizziness, or insomnia postoperatively, whereas all these symptoms occurred much less often in the women who had had operations other than hysterectomy.
Hysterectomy is often necessary, but comes with an assortment of risks and potential complications. Most hysterectomies are performed in premenopausal adult women to treat benign conditions. This matters because new research shows that the procedure could raise the odds of having other health problems later in life. Risks were even greater for women who have the surgery before age 35.
It has been known for some time that as soon as ovaries are removed, (also called oophorectomy) women go into menopause, which raises risk for many health conditions:
Even in cases where the ovaries have been kept intact, the loss of ovarian functions may happen over a period of time. Uterus and the ovaries share blood supply, so it is inevitable that once the uterus is removed the ovaries stop functioning to their fullest capacity.</p>
<p>2. In a study of 4,188 women, those who had hysterectomy without ovarian removal were more likely to have:
 High cholesterol, High blood pressure, Irregular heartbeat
 Obesity- it impedes the agility of women and their capacity to work. 
 Diabetes- Increased risk of diabetes has also been found to be linked to hysterectomy. 
 Alzheimer’s disease – Surgical menopause increases the odds of having Alzheimer’s disease
 Loss of height: Shocking as it may seem, but there is a great chance of reduction in your height after hysterectomy. Bone problems resulting from menopause cause the space between two vertebrae to reduce. This problem also causes nerves to jam between the bones, giving rise to issues like frozen shoulder, sciatica etc.
Bladder problems increase: Since the uterus provides support to the bladder and the bowels, urinary incontinence is seen among women who undergo hysterectomy. Even sneezing and laughing may cause loss of bladder control in such cases.</p>
<p>3. A study conducted by the Maharashtra Legislative Council revealed that out of the 13,861 women in Beed who had undergone the operation, more than 45 percent of them experienced aching joints, back pain, depression, insomnia etc. Other studies suggest that post-operation, side effects like ovarian reserve reduction, increased incidence of heart disease, and early onset of osteoporosis, amongst several others, can be witnessed. Considerable weight gain after the surgery is also common, which impedes the agility of women and their capacity to work. Increased risk of diabetes has also been found to be linked to hysterectomy.

The surgery ups the risk of many health conditions that may arise after it. 
Hence, proactively increasing the wellness quotient by taking following appropriate measures assumes paramount importance. </p>

      <li>Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:
Removing the uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) and ovaries (oophorectomy). If you haven't experienced menopause, removing the ovaries will start menopausal symptoms.

<li>Radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: 
The removal of the uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, the upper portion of the vagina and some surrounding tissue and lymph nodes is done. This type of hysterectomy is performed when cancer is involved.
